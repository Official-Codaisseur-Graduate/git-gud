      <h1>GitGud</h1>
      <p>A validator of your GitHub profile and Git use, designed to provide feedback for job seekers  and graduate students</p>

    </div>
    <div className="landing-page__description">    
      <h2>HOW</h2>
      <p>
      <b>First it checks your public profile</b> - A good GitHub profile can impress the interviewer.
      </p>
      <b>Second it validates your pinned repositories on how you use Git</b>
      - Proper use of version control with Git can show that you are a structured worker and is able to work 
          in development teams. We chose to focus on your pinned repos because you can present certain project as 
          you portfolio for potential employers
    
    </div>
    <div className="landing-page__description">    
      <h2>WHY</h2>
      <p>You can use GitHub as your resume for job hunting. For developers it is important to code regularly, be able to work in teams, communicate properly and contiue with a learning curve. Obviously this is something you say you can do and write it on your resume, but with GitHub you are able to show that you can do this. Which will give you headsup on your next interview.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately many recent graduates or job seekers lack a proper GitHub profile. And as Codaisseur teachers can acknowledge, the feedback seems repetitive. Therefore we developed this tool to provide this feedback which is based on various resources accross the internet and using live data from the GitHub API. </p>

    <div className="landing-page__description">    
      <h2>WHO</h2>
      <p>As three graduates of the Codaisseur Academy in Amsterdam we developed this tool from scratch with Rein op â€˜t Land - a teacher and developer at Codaisseur - who acted as our Product Owner</p>
